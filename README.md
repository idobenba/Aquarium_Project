This project is a simulation of an aquarium, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It features two types of fish and two types of crabs, providing an interactive experience where you can manage the aquarium's inhabitants.

Key features include:

  - Adding Animals: You can add animals to the aquarium by choosing from the existing list of fish and crabs.
  - Feeding: You have the ability to feed the animals that are already in the aquarium.
  - Movement Simulation: You can progress the simulation by one step or multiple steps, with each fish or crab moving based on predefined instructions given during their creation.
  - 
The simulation includes a life cycle system:

  - Animals need to be fed regularly. If they go unfed for a few days (steps), they will die.
  - Animals also have a lifespan defined by their age, which is set by the user at the time of creation. If they reach their maximum age, they will die naturally.
  - 
Additionally, you can run an automatic mode, where the simulation handles the creation, movement, and feeding of animals without user input.
